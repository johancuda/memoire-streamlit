# Elden Ring topic modeling app

 A Streamlit app to try out topic modeling on Elden Ring data.

 ## Description

 This project aims to explore Elden Ring's textual content using [BERTopic](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic) as topic modeling method. The texts were extracted using [UXM Selective Unpack](https://github.com/Nordgaren/UXM-Selective-Unpack) and [Yabber](https://github.com/JKAnderson/Yabber).

 ## Installation

To install this project, we recommend that you create a virtual environment and install the `requirements.txt` file.

 To test the hyperparametrization, run the Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run streamlit_topics.py` in the folder.
